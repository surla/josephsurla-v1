        My passion for programming started when I worked as retail employee at
        Apple. In my role as Creative Pro, I helped others learn how to code. My
        job was to teach and inspire the next generation of creatives and
        software engineers which in turn, helped me realize my desire to
        becoming a software developer. Seeing firsthand how developers
        positively impacted peoples lives through technology, I wanted do the
        same.
