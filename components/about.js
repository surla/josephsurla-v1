        My passion for programming started when I was a retail employee at
        Apple. In my role as Creative Pro, I helped others learn how to code. My
        job was to teach and inspire the next generation of creatives and
        software engineers. I recognize how developers positively impacted
        peoples lives through technology by building and creating software.
        <br />
        <br />I enjoy coding in JavaScript for the web and Java for desktop
        applications.
